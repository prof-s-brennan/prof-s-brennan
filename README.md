- 👋 Hi, I’m @prof-s-brennan, as the name suggests - I'm a professor specializing in automated vehicles at Penn State University

- 👀 I’m interested in data-sharing, automation algorithms, ground vehicle dynamics, and advanced sensing.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to automate database generation as a function of the dynamics of systems that use the database. I'm also learning Python and re-learning C++ along the way!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most projects.

- 📫 How to reach me: sbrennan@psu.edu, or my research page at: www.mne.psu.edu/ToBoldlyGo
